anova.R:
- perform_anova: Use when you have 2 or more groups and want to compare their means. Check if you have 'score' and 'group' columns in your data.

chi_test.R:
- perform_chi_square_test: Use when you have observed frequencies and want to compare them with expected frequencies. Useful for categorical data.

one_population.R:
- one_population_z_test: Use when testing a single proportion against a claimed proportion. Check if you have a success count, sample size, and claimed proportion.

t_test.R:
- t_test: Use when you have a sample and want to compare its mean against a population mean. Ensure you know the confidence level and whether the test is one or two-tailed.
two_populations.R
- two_proportion_z_test: Use when comparing proportions from two different populations. Requires success and sample sizes for both populations.
- pooled_variance_t_test: Use when comparing means from two populations assuming equal variances. Requires sample data for both populations.
- paired_t_test: Use when comparing means from two related populations. Useful for before-and-after scenarios.

z_test.R:
- z_test: Use when you have a sample mean, size, and population mean and standard deviation. Decide if it's a one or two-tailed test.

General Hints:
- When testing means, think t_test or z_test.
- When testing proportions, think one_population_z_test or two_proportion_z_test.
- 'two-tailed' typically checks for any difference, while 'one-tailed' checks for a specific direction of difference.
- Check the required assumptions for each test, like normal distribution or sample size.



1 sample for mean - z-test / t-test if n<30
# If p < alpha, reject H0

«For tests for the differences between two groups, first determine whether your data
are categorical or numerical:                 
      • If your data are categorical, use the Z test for the difference between two proportions.     
      • If your data are numerical, determine whether you have independent or related groups:
            If you have independent groups, use the pooled variance t test for the difference between two means.
            If you have related groups, use the paired t test.»
